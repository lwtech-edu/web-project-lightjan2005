Hi! I am Kai Ying Chan but I prefer to be called Lite Jan. I'm from Taiwan and I used to study electrical engineering. After working in the
industry for one year I decided I wanted to pursue a different career. 
This is a wire frame of the website that I will be creating. Will try my best to make it look better!

I added some information about the wireframe.
