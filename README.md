Hi! I am Kai Ying Chan but I prefer to be called Lite Jan. I'm from Taiwan and I used to study electrical engineering. After working in the
industry for one year I decided I wanted to pursue a different career. 
This is a wire frame of the website that I will be creating. Will try my best to make it look better!

I added some information about the wireframe.

 2/27/2020 Web Phase 2 
Made the whole website with HTML and CSS
added javascript functions so that it would hide my projects at first, when press button will toggle the projects
update input validation though the message box still doesn't work
when click on aboutMePic, it will change a photo
I will try to focus on putting multiple photos and create a button. The screen will show the multiple photos but smaller
Another thing that I would like to focus on is creating more buttons and probably give the user a choice to randomize the background color
or certain sections or articles.
